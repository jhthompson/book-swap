  - [x] Create listings with PENDING state
  - [ ] Some sort of page to view all PENDING listings (i.e. preview image, title, authors) and approve or deny them 
- [x] Tighter coupling to ISBNs for listings... can populate much better data based on that field

  - [ ] ISBN lookup on OpenLibrary fails? 
  - [ ] what if there is no cover image on OpenLibrary? Should they have to take a picture?
