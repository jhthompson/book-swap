- [x] Send email when someone proposes a swap with you
- [x] Page (map view?) to explore nearby books
- [x] Send emails for more swap lifecycle events (accepted, declined)
- [ ] Improve search (sort by distance? use Postgres text search instead of icontains?)
- [x] What to do with deleted listings? Should it be a soft delete, related to the "completed" state when a swap is over perhaps?
- [x] Improve style of signup & login forms (likely override allauth templates)
- [x] Add continued messaging functionality... once "accepted", can message one another?
